# What is University Management System (UMS)?

Assalam-u-Alaikum!

University Management System is a sort of LMS where Admin can register instructors and instructor can register students and mark their attendance and academic records. Student see their record by loging into their respective accounts. It is similar to my [UN Portal](https://github.com/ahsannjavaid/un-portal/) project but one actor (Admin) is additional and also some functionalites are more logical in this project.

## Summary/Flow of the Project:

1. Admin is a secret entity. Admin can register instructors and courses of the university.
2. Instructor can then offer course(s) that are being registered by the university (Admin).
3. Students can register the courses offered by the instructors.
3. Instructor can post marks of different activities done in class against each student's record.
4. Then students can signup/login to their accounts through the Student ID / Amail Address.
5. Students can check their received marks in different subjects enrolled by their instructors.


# Technology Used

MERN Stack

## Client/Frontend

* React.js
* Bootstrap 5

## Server/Backend

* Express.js
* Node.js

## Database

* MongoDB


# Hosting

I have used free services for the hosting of this project.

## Client (Front-end)

The front-end has been hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Server (Back-end)

The back-end has been hosted on [Render](https://www.render.com/).


# Server: Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB

## Available Scripts

First of all install dependencies by typing following command in **server** directory:

### `npm install`

In the server directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the server in the development mode at URL [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001).


# Client: Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

First of all install dependencies by typing following command in **client** directory:

### `npm install`

In the client directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
